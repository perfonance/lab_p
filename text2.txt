One of the simpler yet most effective tools to master in Python are its data visualization and dashboarding libraries. Python dramatically extends what is possible when visualizing data. LIbraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly, provide you with the ability to create robust, complex, and highly customizable visualizations that can make any presentation or plot truly stand out. Moreover, by mastering the Dash package, you’ll be able to build incredibly rich dashboard web applications, deploy them and share them with colleagues, at zero cost. 

How to get started 
Course: Introduction to Data Visualization with Seaborn 
Course: Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib
Course: Introduction to Data Visualization with Plotly in Python
Course: Building Dashboards with Dash and Plotly
Skill Track: Data Visualization with Python
2. Automate Repetitive Data Manipulation Workflows

Many tasks that involve data are often a series of repetitive steps that are repeated on a daily or weekly basis. A great example of this is supply chain forecasting for example, where analysts perform weekly forecasts by following a series of data manipulation steps and simple forecasting techniques. 

Python allows you to create scripts, which can be run and scheduled automatically when combined with some command-line knowledge. Moreover, with the use of functions, you can store complex data manipulation tasks usually performed on data and slightly adapt it to your needs, instead of re-creating analysis from scratch. 

How to get started 
Course: Writing Functions in Python
Course: Data Manipulation with pandas 
Course: Software Engineering for Data Scientists in Python
Career Track: Python Programmer 
3. Accelerate Financial Analysis Workflows

One of Python’s main killer features is its rich and feature-packed machine learning packages. Scikit-learn, is the standard package for machine learning within the industry and is used by the majority of data scientists today. Mastering scikit-learn and machine learning will allow you to build predictive models such as customer churn models, movie recommendation systems, and more.

Moreover, deep learning packages such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch, are the driving engines behind awe-inspiring machine learning use-cases such as self-driving cars, intelligent chatbots, and other cognitive applications.
